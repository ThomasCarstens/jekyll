<h2>Oh, hello!</h2>
<br><i>Welcome to my blog and my showroom of my own projects.</i></br>

<br>I am a mechanical and mechatronic engineer by training and I also do software development.
I have worked on projects designing and developing electro-mechanical systems as well as mobile apps.
Right now I am studying to become a roboticist (Ecole EFREI, Master's in droides and drones, 2019-2021).
Today's technology is growing fast, and my favourite strategy is to develop solutions that empower users.
My previous projects have done just that: an everyday consumer product, a user-centred online platform,
a healthcare robot. I write about my projects, and I am working to build myself up as a tech entrepreneur,
so do check out the blog I have here! While I'm in Paris, I am financing my studies with work as a developer.
If you are interested in what I am doing feel free to contact me
