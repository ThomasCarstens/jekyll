Happy New Year everybody.

I started this year off with a paper presentation for the [TWiML&AI EMEA Meetup](https://twimlai.com/meetup/) titled "Deep Learning for Remote Sensing Applications". A brief intro to optical and radar-based remote sensing and a deep learning application for generating optimal images based on radar and previous time-step images by He and Yokoya (2018). It's a nice application illustrating the use of CNN and cGAN and data fusion based on auxiliary radar images to generate optical images that might be compromised by clouds or missing-data.

For your convenience the open-access paper discussed can be found [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/7/10/389), the slides can be downloaded <a download href="{{ page.document_path }}">[here]</a>, and the link to the meetup recording will be provided [here](https://twimlai.com/meetups/) once Sam releases it into the wild.
