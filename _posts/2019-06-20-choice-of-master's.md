# My choice of master's
Read this if you see yourself as a developer, but uncertain about choosing a career direction.

Whoever works in tech development knows it’s difficult to do something other than an entry-level engineering job, e.g. maintenance and quality control. I did such things in internships and I wanted to enter job in robotics. This was simply not possible with this baseline degree, and unless I knew the right people, I realised that this ‘world of work’ is a little more complicated than what I expected.

## Who is concerned by this?
Those graduating as an engineering generalist specifically from [UCT](https://www.uct.co.za), but uncertain about choosing a career direction for many possible reasons:
-	Confused about the current state of technology in the world
-	Even more confused about the future state of technology
-	Don’t know if engineering is really for you (there’s more of us than you think)
-	Unsure about your own skillset / what value you can contribute to the ‘world of work’
-	Want to choose a direction that’s financially stable in 5 years from now (at least!)

## What this is really about
This is about my path after a Bachelors in Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering. I spent the last 6 months applying to various places. It felt a lot like the kind of part-time job where I get paid months later. After heeding advice from people like Matt from Skillup, I realised many mechanical engineers struggle to find good master’s programmes, or even to know which direction to go in. So here’s my journey.

### Watch this space!
I will soon be posting about ways to contribute value to the world, influenced by books like Traction (Weinberg) and Talk to Me (Valhos).
Also I'm currently checking with a friend if I can feature his advice on the best scholarships for undergraduate students. I also will write about the best scholarships for graduate students. Watch this space...

## The places I applied to
Before I explain my career motivations: Here is a summary of my masters’ applications, in order of application.
1. MIT Media Lab | Media innovation at the Responsive Environments Lab or the Fluid Interfaces Lab, 2y | rejected
2. Paris Saclay Fablab | digital fabrication, 8months | aborted (no scholarship)
3. Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC), Barcelona | Robotics for construction, 1y | accepted but aborted (expensive, competed unsuccessfully for scholarship, too specialised)
4. KTH, Stockholm| Autonomous Systems, 2y | aborted (uploaded files accidentally corrupted)
5. Malmö University, Malmö, Sweden| Interaction Design, 2y | aborted (uploaded files accidentally corrupted)
5. EIT Digital, Madrid+Paris | HCID, 2y | accepted with scholarship, aborted (reservations about HCID)
6. Ecole EFREI, Paris | Embedded systems in Droides & Drones, 2y | accepted, going.
7. EMARO+, Nantes+Zurich | Advanced Robotics, 2y | aborted (reference letter uploaded too late)
8. Emerson College, Boston | Civic Media Design, 1y | accepted with scholarship, aborted (still too expensive relative to time spent)
9. Ecole Polytechnique Paris | Product development and business management as ‘Internet of Things, Innovation and Management’, 2y | accepted with 0% interest loan, aborted (reservations about curriculum)
10. EURECOM, Sofia-Antipolis | telecommunications as ‘Internet of Things’, 2y | rejected.


## My motivations
I decided I would do a Masters in a specific field as a way to develop a strong suit for employers (T-shaped skills). Points that appealed to me for various Masters were:
-	A 2 year programme | What can I realistically achieve in a year that can position me in the right place?
-	Scholarship/bursary preferably | There are financial constraints
-	Europe | For the experience of living independently overseas
-	Paris | I have a French passport and family residing in Paris (very fortunate)
-	Program with industrial exposure | It shows that the program caters to the needs of companies, and so the program has the most current technologies and high employability.

That been said, I obviously had certain paths in mind based on my own experience.

### Boston, USA
My goal is to ultimately study a Masters in Boston. The MIT Media Lab has caught my attention as a hub of technological development with a major human focus. Just landing in Boston is a move I really would like to make. As a result, I applied to MIT (in media innovation) and Emerson College (in civic media design). I was rejected from MIT (not really surprised) and Emerson College offered me a place, but when getting down to the costs, I realised it was too bold a career move.

### Studying as soon as possible
I really wanted to study something for free as soon as I could. As a result, I applied to Paris Saclay (in digital fabrication). Yet I did not receive a scholarship, so, no cigar.

### Platform design
My senior research project was in app development. I developed and implemented a custom mobile app at the University of Cape Town. I liked how much potential there is for impact in the daily life of people, i.e. to create a product that has direct implementational value and is scalable. As a result, I applied and Malmö University (in interaction design) and EIT Digital (in human-computer interfaces). For Malmö, I didn’t send my transcript in the right format and I was therefore ineligible. As for EIT Digital, I was accepted around the same time as other programmes and it caused me to think hard about platform design. I realised that it may be fun and somehow lucrative, but I was aware that it was not a very stable field to work in. After all, app development will not be booming in 5 years as it is now (according to software developers at a local tech hub, Codebridge). Students at EIT describe their internships as marred by difficulties to convince the company of the worth of their work. That did not appeal to me.

### Something mechatronic
I could not ignore the direction set by my degree in Mechanical and Mechatronic engineering. The options above show a transition from my studies. However, some options can further me as a technical engineer such as autonomous systems and robotics. As a result, I applied to IAAC (in robotics for construction), KTH (in autonomous systems) and EMARO+ (in advanced robotics). I was accepted in the first, but I accidentally messed up my application files for the next two (what a waste of time…). Careful consideration of the field of robotics for construction made me realise that it is in its nascent stages. There is actually very little guarantee of it being a stable field in a few years. According to reports by BCG and Bain, there is a major push to bring robotics on the construction site (land-surveying drones, land-forming robots) but the actual needs of construction companies have not been spelled out yet. This did not appeal to me.

### Tech entrepreneurship
I have a passion for tech entrepreneurship. This means that engineering programmes with a management component are particularly interesting. As a result, I applied to Polytechnique Paris (in product development and business management). I actually got in, and I was proud due to the school’s prestige in the local region. I however thought I should consult students of the programme because, you know, tuition alone costs 24000€. I managed to speak to 4 students. I realised that this programme trains students to be experts in a very specific telecommunications technology (Bluetooth, Wifi) and using this training, the second year then supports the students in developing their own business/consulting for a corporate. This is bold. It’s a huge risk. What if my business doesn’t make it 5 years from now? Recent reports by Cisco and BCG show severe limitations for the Internet of Things to gain traction within business, but will it happen in the next 5 years? Or will my business struggle to get started? And in 5 years I will also be required to pay back the 24000€. Will I be able to rely on the network of alumni like Polytechnique proclaims? I know that a Master’s is in itself a bold move; but odds these high are a bit too uncertain for me.

### System development
After conversations with three CEOs of product development companies, I realised that it would be very strategic to gain skills in system development. My approach, basically, is to gain even more experience as a developer, while learning the technologies involved in two of the most promising fields coming up in the next few years: in robotics and in cloud computing. As a result, I applied to EURECOM (in telecommunications) and Ecole EFREI (in embedded systems). I was cleanly rejected from the first. But I was accepted in to the second. So, all in all, what does EFREI offer me? I like it a lot. Here is the final summary.

## Summary
Ecole EFREI seems like the most strategic direction for me, because I did decide I would do a Masters in a specific field as a way to develop a strong suit for employers (upskilling). This is an opportunity:
-	To establish myself as a capable robotics engineer via my projects and the French professional license offered by the school.
-	To search for work that can help finance my studies, and internships that can give me experience in robotics.
-	To become much more familiar with the tech market over the next 2 years than I am now.
In terms of time and money:
- It’s a 2 year-programme (what I am looking for).
- There is a bursary covering me for the next 5 years, and fortunately if I work as a robotic engineer I can pay them back under 2 years.
- The program definitely has industrial exposure, with two 3-5month internships, and the school’s local ranking is astonishing. Thus the program has the most current technologies and high employability.
- Aside from all this… Living in a different culture (Paris rather than Cape Town) is going to teach me a huge lot. I’m going to love it. I can’t wait to reconnect with French family.
