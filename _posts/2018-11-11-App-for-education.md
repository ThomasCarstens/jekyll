# ![favicon](/assets/images/favicon.jpg){: .aligned-left} App for an Engineering Undergraduate Course

Supervised by Bruce Kloot of Mechanical Engineering UCT, I designed and developed a mobile application for enhanced interaction in engineering learning and I implemented within two undergraduate courses.

## Project Presentation
I presented the project at UCT's Teaching and Learning Conference (July 2019). I added timestamps for specific sections (**App Features**, **Security Measures**...), and you can [view the video on Youtube:](https://youtu.be/sG-mX4-pG2E)

## Aim
The goal of this project was to design an online learning space as an effective means for students to interact with tutors in the Dynamics 1 course. In this course, students are required to apply the mechanics concepts in weekly exercises. Students studying at odd hours do not necessarily have access to the right resources if they need help. This application offers a way of remotely contacting the tutors. Using the app, students can now post a question in a feed for tutors to be notified immediately. The app was serviced on the Google Playstore, and on Testflight on the iStore (via invite link). Such a tool was novel in the UCT Mechanical Engineering Department. I hope this proof of concept can be expanded to other university courses.

### Time-bound:
4 months development.

### Limitations
There was no guarantee that students would even use the app. I simply thought it would be useful from my experience at UCT.


## Project Plan
The success of the project required that an online space be developed and implemented. Additionally, it required a means to measure whether the online space has enhanced the students’ experience of the course. For the first part, the online space must be conceived, developed and implemented within the course; for the second part, an indicator is chosen to measure the success of this space.
This project was planned in a sequence of phases:
