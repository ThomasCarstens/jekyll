# Milk frother mechanical design
The product design course enable to learn and experience on how the design ingredients such as art, science, engineering, practical experiences and ingenuity could be blended in a design process to evolve a state of art- top of the line   product or processes.

This project required me to design a conventional engineering device. The design is to be performed holistically, duly considering market opportunities and product architecture, needs identification, requirement formulation, planning and managing the process, concept generation and selection, detail design and drawing, financial and technical performance analysis and communicating the design solution.
