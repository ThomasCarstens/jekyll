<h2>Welcome</h2>

This is my blog and my project showroom.

I am currently freelancing in Paris while studying my master's in droides and drones. I am currently looking for freelance work.
My previous projects have sought to develop solutions that are useful to end-users: everyday consumer products, online platforms, service robots. I tweet about tech news, I blog about my projects and I am seeking funding for my business ventures. Browse for more and feel free to contact me.
