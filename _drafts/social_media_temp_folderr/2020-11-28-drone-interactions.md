# Drone interactions
I am a final-year student in the Masters in Innovation, Research and Manufacturing. I work on drones, big and small, fast, graceful and often rebellious.

My main contribution to the DVIC is the experimentation platform for drones. I present different technologies, hardware and software resources and a few projects that used the platform. The website link is:
https://dvic.devinci.fr/en/resource/members/thomas_carstens

It goes without saying that my tutorials present the structure of this platform and more information on the technologies that were used. The autonomous drone is a domain that is evolving quickly, recently boosted by a drone race for autonomous drones, and always seeking out cutting-edge technologies.
