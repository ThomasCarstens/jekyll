Some of us would see drones as weapons of war, but the arcade machine is perhaps the right object to remind us that drones are a technology just like another, at the service of innovation.

*This project is in progress. More updates will be added soon.*

The Drone Lab is an active area of innovation at the DVIC. Various projects developed at the Drone Lab include drone dances, coordination between human gestures and drones, and other applications that use precise movements of robots. This project aims to:

- Add a frontend to the Crossreality project
- Add a frontend to the Drone piloting with hands project.
- Fly the drones with two joysticks - why not...
- Offer a supervision area for researchers to vacate the drone arena while tests are still running.
